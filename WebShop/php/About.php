        <h2>Welcome to Kaspers Shop</h2>
        <p>This website is made as a project made by Kasper Janssen. They are a second year student studying Embedded Software/Computer Science in The Netherlands. </p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>In their free time Kasper likes to game, especially Beat Saber. For this game he has also made multiple overlays for tournaments. Furthermore they love playing the bass-guitar, especially in their band called "De Stichting". Here they play mostly Rock/Pop-Rock and are constantly looking for fun gigs! Kasper has also grown up on a boat and loves sailing in the little free time he has.</p>
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>Kasper hopes to finish the study within 4 years and is thinking about doing a masters afterwards. They also hope to be able to perform with their band more often.</p>
